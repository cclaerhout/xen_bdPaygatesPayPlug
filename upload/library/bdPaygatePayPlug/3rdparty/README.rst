Usage
=====

Here's how simple it is to create a payment request :

.. sourcecode :: php

    <?php
    require_once("PATH_TO_PAYPLUG/payplug_php/lib/Payplug.php");

    // Loads your account's parameters that you've previously downloaded and saved
    Payplug::setConfigFromFile("PATH_TO_PAYPLUG/parameters.json");

    // Creating a payment request of â‚¬9.99. The payment confirmation (IPN) will be sent to "http://www.example.org/callbackURL"
    $paymentUrl = PaymentUrl::generateUrl(array(
                                         'amount' => 999,
                                         'currency' => 'EUR',
                                         'ipnUrl' => 'http://www.example.org/ipn.php',
                                         'email' => 'john.doe@example.fr', /* Your customer mail address */
                                         'firstName' => 'John',
                                         'lastName' => 'Doe'
                                         ));

    // Redirects the user to the payment page
    header("Location: $paymentUrl");
    exit();
